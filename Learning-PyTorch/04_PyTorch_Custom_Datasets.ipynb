        "|0. Importing PyTorch and setting up device-agnostic code|Let's get PyTorch loaded and then follow best practice to setup our code to be device-agnostic.|\n",
        "|1. Get data|We're going to be using our own **custom dataset** of pizza, steak and sushi images.|\n",
        "|2. Become one with the data (data preparation)|At the beginning of any new machine learning problem, it's paramount to understand the data you're working with. Here we'll take some steps to figure out what data we have.|\n",
        "|3. Transforming data|Often, the data you get won't be 100% ready to use with a machine learning model, here we'll look at some steps we can take to *transform* our images so they're ready to be used with a model.|\n",
        "|4. Loading data with `ImageFolder` (option 1)|PyTorch has many in-built data loading functions for common types of data. `ImageFolder` is helpful if our images are in standard image classification format.|\n",
        "|5. Loading image data with a custom `Dataset`|What if PyTorch didn't have an in-built function to load data with? This is where we can build our own custom subclass of `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.|\n",
        "|6. Other forms of transforms (data augmentation)|Data augmentation is a common technique for expanding the diversity of your training data. Here we'll explore some of `torchvision`'s in-built data augmentation functions.|\n",
        "|7. Model 0: TinyVGG without data augmentation|By this stage, we'll have our data ready, let's build a model capable of fitting it. We'll also create some training and testing functions for training and evaluating our model.|\n",
        "|8. Exploring loss curves|Loss curves are a great way to see how your model is training/improving over time. They're also a good way to see if your model is **underfitting** or **overfitting**.|\n",
        "|9. Model 1: TinyVGG with data augmentation|By now, we've tried a model *without*, how about we try one with data augmentation?|\n",
        "|10. Compare model results|Let's compare our different models' loss curves and see which performed better and discuss some options for improving performance.|\n",
        "|11. Making a prediction on a custom image|Our model is trained to on a dataset of pizza, steak and sushi images. In this section we'll cover how to use our trained model to predict on an image outside of our existing dataset.|"
