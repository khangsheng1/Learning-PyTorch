# PyTorch Tutorial

This repository contains my notes and code implementations while following a PyTorch tutorial from [Codemy.com](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodemyDotCom).

## About the Course

This course covers the basics of PyTorch, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. It is ideal for those who are new to PyTorch or want to reinforce their knowledge in neural networks, tensors, and building machine learning models. The tutorial is available on YouTube.

## Repository Structure

The following Jupyter notebooks are included in this repository:

- **Intro_to_Colab.ipynb**: A brief introduction to Google Colab, including how to use it for running PyTorch models.
- **Tensors.ipynb**: Introduction to tensors in PyTorch, explaining what they are and how they work.
- **Tensor_Math.ipynb**: Explores basic tensor operations and mathematical functions in PyTorch.
- **Tensor_Ops.ipynb**: A deeper dive into advanced tensor operations.
- **Simple_NeuralNetwork.ipynb**: Builds a simple feed-forward neural network using PyTorch to get hands-on experience with neural networks.
- **CIFAR10_Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb**: A more complex implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PyTorch-Tutorial.git
   ```
2. Open the notebooks in Google Colab or any Jupyter Notebook environment.

3. Follow along with the YouTube tutorial on Codemy.com for detailed explanations and walkthroughs.
